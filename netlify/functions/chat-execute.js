  "Am I Eligible for Express Entry?": `Great question! Let me break this down simply:

✅ YOU'RE LIKELY ELIGIBLE IF:
• You have at least 1 year of skilled work experience (NOC TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3)
• You have IELTS/CELPIP results (or can get them)
• Your degree can be assessed by WES/IQAS
• You're under 45 years old

❌ RED FLAGS THAT DISQUALIFY MOST PEOPLE:
• Less than 1 year continuous work experience
• Work experience in NOC 4 or 5 (low-skilled)
• No post-secondary education
• Criminal record or medical inadmissibility

📊 QUICK REALITY CHECK:
The current average ITA cutoff is around 490-535 CRS. If you're:
• 25-35 years old
• Bachelor's degree + 3 years work experience
• IELTS CLB 7-8
• Single applicant

You're probably sitting at 380-450 CRS — which means you NEED a strategy to close the gap.

💡 WANT YOUR EXACT CRS SCORE?
Tell me your: Age | Education | Work years | IELTS scores | Marital status

I'll calculate it in 30 seconds and show you EXACTLY what you need to improve.

🚀 Or get your full roadmap with Execute ($100/year) — I'll audit your profile, flag risks, and map every step to ITA.`,

  "What's My Realistic CRS Score?": `Let's calculate this together! I need 5 quick details:

1️⃣ Your age: _____
2️⃣ Education level: (High school / Bachelor's / Master's / PhD)
3️⃣ Years of skilled work: _____
4️⃣ IELTS scores: L__ R__ W__ S__ (or planned target)
5️⃣ Marital status: (Single / Married)

Once you give me these, I'll calculate your estimated CRS range and show you:

🎯 WHERE YOU STAND:
• Latest ITA cutoff: 535 (May 2024)
• Your gap to overcome: [X] points

🔥 HOW TO CLOSE THE GAP:
If you improve IELTS from CLB 7 to CLB 9:
→ +50 points (this is the easiest win)

💪 FASTEST PATH TO CLB 9?
Evolve is designed to help you jump from CLB 7 to CLB 9 in 6-8 weeks using our 33-simulation boot camp. Based on IELTS research, students who complete structured practice typically gain 1-2 bands.

🤖 WANT A FULL STRATEGY SESSION?
Execute analyzes your ENTIRE profile — documents, PNP options, job offers, timeline risks — and builds a step-by-step plan.`,

  "How Long Will This Take?": `Straight answer: **6-18 months** from starting ECA to landing in Canada.

Here's the realistic timeline breakdown:

⏰ PHASE 1: PREP (3-6 months)
• Educational Credential Assessment (ECA): 4-8 weeks
• IELTS exam + prep: 2-12 weeks (depends on your English level)
• Gather documents (work letters, transcripts, passport): 2-4 weeks
• Create Express Entry profile: 1 day

⏰ PHASE 2: WAITING FOR ITA (1-12 months)
This is the PAINFUL part. How long depends on your CRS:
• 500+ CRS: 1-3 months (you're golden)
• 450-500 CRS: 3-6 months (competitive)
• 400-450 CRS: 6-12 months (need PNP or improvement)
• Below 400 CRS: 12+ months (or never without strategy)

⏰ PHASE 3: POST-ITA TO PR (4-6 months)
• Submit full application: 2 weeks
• Background checks, medicals, biometrics: 2-3 months
• IRCC processing: 2-3 months
• COPR (Confirmation of PR): Final approval
• Land in Canada: Book your flight!

🚨 BIGGEST TIME WASTERS:
❌ Waiting too long to start IELTS prep (most people need 2-3 attempts)
❌ Choosing wrong ECA agency (delays by 6+ weeks)
❌ Missing document requirements (costly re-submissions)
❌ Not having a PNP backup plan

⚡ Having a strategic approach can save 3-4 months on average by catching document errors BEFORE submission, identifying PNP opportunities early, and monitoring your profile effectively.

• Proof of funds: ~$13,000+ CAD (must show in bank, not spent)

📊 TOTAL BASELINE: ~$15,500 - $17,000 CAD

💸 OPTIONAL BUT SMART:
• IELTS prep course (generic): $500-$2,000 CAD
• Immigration consultant (traditional): $2,000-$5,000 CAD

😱 TOTAL WITH CONSULTANT: ~$20,000 - $25,000 CAD

---

🎯 THE MIGRATE NORTH ALTERNATIVE:

💪 EVOLVE (IELTS boot camp): $100 CAD/year
• 33 full-length simulations

  // === SECTION 2: TOP CONCERNS ===
  "My CRS Is Too Low - What Now?": `I hear you. CRS below 450 feels like a death sentence... but it's NOT.

Here's the truth the big consultants won't tell you:

📉 YOU'RE NOT ALONE:
According to IRCC data, the majority of Express Entry candidates sit between 380-450 CRS. The system is DESIGNED to favor younger applicants with Master's degrees, which locks out most people.

But here's what successful applicants do differently:

---

🎯 STRATEGY #1: BOOST IELTS (EASIEST WIN)
Going from CLB 7 → CLB 9 adds **+50 points**

The numbers:
• CLB 7 = 96 CRS points (language)
• CLB 9 = 132 CRS points (language)
• Gain = +36 to +50 points total (with skill transferability)

⚡ This is why Evolve exists. Research shows that structured, progressive practice (like our 33-simulation system) helps most students improve 1-2 CLB bands in 6-8 weeks.

---

🎯 STRATEGY #2: PROVINCIAL NOMINEE PROGRAM (INSTANT +600)
PNP is your cheat code. A nomination = automatic 600 points.

But here's the catch: Each province has different rules, and you need to TARGET the right one.

🔥 HOT PNP OPTIONS RIGHT NOW:
• Ontario HCP: Tech workers with CRS 400+
• BC Tech: Software jobs, no LMIA needed
• Alberta AOS: Open to most NOCs, 300 CRS minimum
• Saskatchewan: Fastest processing (3-4 months)

💡 Execute tracks ALL 80+ PNP streams and tells you which ones you qualify for, when applications open, exact documents needed, and timeline estimates.

Traditional consultants charge $3,000 just for this analysis. Execute does it 24/7 for $100/year.

---

🎯 STRATEGY #3: JOB OFFER (+50-200 points)
LMIA-backed job offers are rare but powerful:
• +50 points for NOC TEER 0 jobs
• +200 points for arranged employment

Where to find them: Job Bank Canada, LinkedIn "Canada + LMIA", direct employer outreach.

Execute can help write your Job Bank profile, optimize your resume for LMIA roles, and track postings.

---

❌ WHAT DOESN'T WORK:
• Just waiting for cutoffs to drop (they won't below 470)
• Paying consultants who don't give you a PLAN
• Faking documents (lifetime ban + criminal charges)

---

💪 YOUR NEXT MOVE:
Tell me your current CRS and I'll show you the FASTEST path to 470+.

You're not stuck. You just need the right strategy. 🚀`,

  "Common Mistakes That Kill Applications": `Let me save you from the 7 deadly mistakes that cause 40% of application rejections or delays (based on IRCC statistics):

---

❌ MISTAKE #1: LYING ABOUT WORK EXPERIENCE
"I'll just stretch my 11 months to 12 months. Who'll check?"

IRCC checks. HARD.

🚨 What they verify:
• Reference letters (they call employers)
• Payslips & tax returns
• LinkedIn vs your application
• Employment gaps

Caught lying = permanent ban + criminal record.

✅ FIX: Only claim work you can 100% prove. Execute reviews your reference letters against IRCC requirements to catch potential issues before submission.

---

❌ MISTAKE #2: WRONG NOC CODE
Pick the wrong NOC = application rejected = start over = lose 6+ months

Example issue:
• Job title: "Marketing Manager" 
• Listed as: NOC 0124
• Actual duties: Social Media Coordinator (NOC 11202)
• Result: Rejection for "Work experience does not match claimed NOC"

✅ FIX: NOC codes are based on DUTIES, not job titles. Execute cross-references your actual tasks against official IRCC definitions.

---

❌ MISTAKE #3: UPLOADING LOW-QUALITY DOCUMENTS
IRCC rejects scans that are:
• Blurry or pixelated
• Partial pages
• Wrong format (must be PDF, under 4MB each)
• Missing stamps/signatures

🚨 One bad scan = "Additional Documents Request" = 30-60 day delay

✅ FIX: 300 DPI minimum, full-color, all pages visible. Execute provides scan quality guidelines.

---

❌ MISTAKE #4: MISSING THE 60-DAY ITA DEADLINE
You get your ITA = you have 60 days to submit everything.

Miss it by 1 day? ITA expires. Back to the pool. Start over.

People underestimate how long it takes to:
• Get police certificates (4-8 weeks in some countries)
• Get medicals scheduled (2-3 weeks)
• Format all documents correctly (2-5 days)

✅ FIX: Start gathering documents BEFORE ITA. Execute has a pre-ITA checklist that tells you exactly what to prepare now.

---

❌ MISTAKE #5: WRONG PROOF OF FUNDS FORMAT
You need $13,310 CAD (single) or $16,570 (couple) in your bank for 6+ months.

❌ IRCC rejects:
• Bank statements in non-English (must translate)
• Money "borrowed" for the screenshot
• Inconsistent balances (sudden deposits = red flag)
• Joint accounts without both names
• Crypto or stocks (not liquid cash)

✅ FIX: Show 6-month average balance, get official bank letter on letterhead. Execute provides templates.

---

❌ MISTAKE #6: SPOUSE'S CREDENTIALS NOT ASSESSED
If you claim points for your spouse's education/experience, THEY need:
• ECA (not just you)
• IELTS (not just you)
• Work reference letters (if claiming points)

Forget spouse's ECA = lose 8-10 points = potential ITA rejection

✅ FIX: Execute calculates if including spouse HELPS or HURTS your CRS (sometimes excluding them is better!)

---

❌ MISTAKE #7: NO BACKUP PLAN
Only applying to Federal Express Entry = risky.

What if:
• CRS cutoffs stay above your score?
• Your work experience becomes ineligible (NOC changes)?
• You age out (lose points)?

✅ FIX: Always have 2-3 PNP backups. Execute tracks 80+ streams and auto-alerts you when you become eligible.

---

🎯 HOW MANY OF THESE WOULD YOU HAVE CAUGHT?

Be honest. If you're not 100% confident, you need expert review.

Don't let a preventable mistake cost you 6 months.`,

  "Will I Get an ITA This Year?": `Let me give you the brutal truth, then the hope:

📊 YOUR ITA PROBABILITY IN 2024:

Based on recent IRCC draw patterns, here's what the data shows:

IF YOUR CRS IS:
• 520+: Very high probability (consistently invited)
• 490-520: Good probability (competitive but achievable)
• 470-490: Moderate probability (need targeted draws or PNP)
• 450-470: Lower probability (strong PNP strategy needed)
• 400-450: Challenging (must improve CRS or pursue PNP)
• Below 400: Very challenging (urgent action needed)

---

🔥 REALITY CHECK - 2024 ITA TRENDS:

Recent cutoffs:
• General draw: 535 CRS (May 15, 2024)
• Category draws (new in 2023):
  - Healthcare: 476 CRS
  - Tech (STEM): 486 CRS
  - Trades: 388 CRS
  - French: 377 CRS

📈 The cutoffs are NOT dropping. Why?
• Record immigration targets (500,000/year)
• BUT also record applications (3M+ in pool)
• Category draws favor specific NOCs

---

💡 SO... WILL YOU GET ITA?

Tell me:
1. Your current CRS: ___
2. Your NOC code: ___
3. Your timeline urgency: (This year? Next year? Flexible?)

And I'll give you a PERSONALIZED probability + action plan.

---

⚡ FASTEST WAYS TO GET ITA IN 2024:

🎯 OPTION 1: Improve CRS to 500+
• Retake IELTS for CLB 9: +50 points
• Get ECA for spouse: +8-10 points
• Gain 1 more year work experience: +4-13 points
• Complete Master's: +23-32 points

🎯 OPTION 2: Target Category Draws
If you're in:
• Healthcare (NOC 31-32): Regular healthcare draws
• STEM/Tech (NOC 21): Tech-focused draws
• Trades (NOC 72-73): Trade-specific draws
• French speakers: Guaranteed advantage with CLB 7 French

🎯 OPTION 3: Provincial Nominee Program (+600 points)
PNP = instant ITA regardless of federal cutoffs

Active streams:
• Ontario HCP (Tech)
• BC Tech (rolling invites)
• Alberta AOS
• Saskatchewan OID

Execute tracks all these + sends alerts when YOU become eligible.

---

🚨 WARNING SIGNS OF DIFFICULTY:
❌ CRS below 400 + no improvement plan
❌ Not eligible for any category draws
❌ Waiting for "cutoffs to drop" (they won't)
❌ No PNP backup strategy

If 2+ of these apply to you, you need to pivot NOW.

💪 YOUR NEXT MOVE:

Pick one:
1. "Calculate my exact ITA probability" (I'll analyze your profile)
2. "Show me my fastest route to 500 CRS" (free strategy)
3. "Set up Execute to monitor everything" ($100/year)

  "How to Boost CRS by 50+ Points Fast": `You want 50+ points? Here's your playbook.

I'm going to give you the EXACT moves that work, ranked by speed and cost:

⚡ FASTEST WIN: Improve IELTS (4-8 weeks)

📊 THE MATH:
CLB 7 → CLB 8: +18-23 points
CLB 7 → CLB 9: +47-54 points
CLB 8 → CLB 9: +24-31 points

🎯 HOW:
Most people get stuck at CLB 7-8 because they study ENGLISH, not the IELTS FORMAT.

IELTS is a game with patterns:
• Writing Task 2: 5 question types (memorize templates)
• Reading: Skim → keyword match (don't read fully)
• Listening: Pre-read questions (beat the audio)
• Speaking: 10 common topics (drill them repeatedly)

📈 WHAT RESEARCH SHOWS:
Studies on IELTS preparation indicate that structured practice with progressive difficulty typically results in 1-2 band improvements over 6-8 weeks for dedicated students.

Evolve uses this research-backed approach with 33 simulations across 3 difficulty levels.

---

💰 BEST VALUE: Spouse Optimization (2-4 months)

If you're married, run THIS calculation:

Option A: Both contribute points (need spouse ECA + IELTS)
Option B: You as primary, spouse not included

Sometimes REMOVING your spouse increases CRS!

📊 EXAMPLE:
You: 32, Bachelor's, 4 yrs experience, CLB 8
Spouse: 35, Bachelor's, 2 yrs experience, CLB 6

With spouse: 425 CRS
Without spouse: 447 CRS
→ +22 points by excluding them!

OR if your spouse is strong:
With spouse (both CLB 9, her Master's): 485 CRS
Without spouse: 445 CRS
→ +40 points by including them!

✅ Execute runs this analysis to show you which option maximizes your CRS.

---

🚀 ULTIMATE CHEAT CODE: Provincial Nominee (+600 points)

This isn't "boosting" CRS—it's OBLITERATING the competition.

PNP = 600 points = instant ITA

But PNPs are competitive. You need:
• Right NOC code
• Right work experience years
• Right CRS range (varies by stream)
• Fast application (some close in 2-3 days)

🔥 ACTIVE PNP OPPORTUNITIES (June 2024):
• Ontario HCP (Tech): Needs 400+ CRS, Bachelor's+, 1yr+ experience
• BC Tech: Rolling invites
• Alberta AOS: 300+ CRS, any skilled NOC
• Saskatchewan OID: No job offer needed, fastest processing

Execute tracks 80+ PNP streams and alerts you when new intakes open, you become eligible, or application deadlines approach.

---

📊 YOUR ACTION PLAN:

If you want 50+ points in:
• 4-8 weeks: IELTS improvement (Evolve)
• 2-4 months: Spouse optimization or PNP application (Execute)
• 12-24 months: Additional education

Pick your timeline. Tell me your CRS and I'll build your roadmap.

📖 IELTS ACADEMIC READING - SAMPLE PASSAGE

You have 8 minutes. Read the passage and answer 5 questions below.

**PASSAGE: The Rise of Vertical Farming**

Urban agriculture is experiencing a renaissance through vertical farming—a practice of growing crops in vertically stacked layers, often in controlled indoor environments. Unlike traditional farming, which demands vast horizontal land, vertical farms utilize height, often transforming abandoned warehouses or purpose-built facilities into productive agricultural hubs.

The technology relies on hydroponics (growing plants in nutrient-rich water), aeroponics (misting roots with nutrients), or aquaponics (combining fish farming with plant cultivation). LED lighting replicates sunlight, while automated systems regulate temperature, humidity, and CO₂ levels. This precision agriculture can yield crops year-round, independent of weather or seasonal constraints.

Advocates tout vertical farming's sustainability credentials: it uses 90% less water than conventional farming, eliminates pesticide dependency, and reduces transportation emissions by situating farms in urban centers near consumers. A single acre of vertical farm can produce yields equivalent to 10-20 acres of traditional farmland.

However, critics highlight significant barriers. Initial capital costs are prohibitive—a mid-sized vertical farm requires $10-30 million investment. Energy consumption is substantial; LED lights and climate control systems can consume more electricity than the embodied energy in conventionally-grown produce transported hundreds of miles. Economic viability remains unproven at scale, with many vertical farming startups struggling financially despite venture capital enthusiasm.

---

**QUESTIONS (Choose TRUE, FALSE, or NOT GIVEN):**

1. Vertical farms can only operate in specific seasons.
2. Vertical farming uses significantly less water than traditional agriculture.
3. The majority of vertical farming companies are currently profitable.
4. Transportation emissions are reduced when vertical farms are located in cities.
5. Aquaponics involves growing plants without soil or water.

---

⏱️ TIME'S UP! Here are the answers:

1. FALSE (Passage states: "yield crops year-round, independent of...seasonal constraints")
2. TRUE (Passage states: "uses 90% less water")
3. NOT GIVEN (Passage mentions "struggling financially" but doesn't specify majority)
4. TRUE (Passage states: "reduces transportation emissions by situating farms...near consumers")
5. FALSE (Aquaponics "combines fish farming with plant cultivation" — not without water)

✍️ IELTS ACADEMIC WRITING - TASK 2

You have 40 minutes. Write at least 250 words.

**QUESTION:**

*Some people believe that governments should invest heavily in public transportation systems to reduce traffic congestion and pollution. Others argue that individuals should be responsible for their own transportation choices.*

*Discuss both views and give your own opinion.*

⏱️ START YOUR TIMER NOW!

[User writes their response]

📊 MODEL ANSWER (CLB 9 level):

*Traffic congestion and environmental pollution are pressing urban challenges that require coordinated solutions. While some advocate for substantial government investment in public transit infrastructure, others contend that transportation remains a matter of personal responsibility. This essay will examine both perspectives before arguing that a balanced approach yields optimal outcomes.*

*Proponents of government-funded public transportation emphasize collective benefits. Extensive metro systems, bus networks, and cycling infrastructure can dramatically reduce private vehicle dependency, thereby alleviating gridlock and carbon emissions. Singapore's Mass Rapid Transit system, for instance, transports over 3 million passengers daily, significantly curbing automobile use. Moreover, well-designed public transit promotes social equity by enabling low-income citizens to access employment opportunities without vehicle ownership costs.*

*Conversely, advocates of individual responsibility argue that personal transportation choices should remain autonomous. They contend that excessive government expenditure on public systems may burden taxpayers while failing to address diverse mobility needs. Rural residents, shift workers, and families with young children often find public transit impractical, necessitating personal vehicles regardless of infrastructure investments.*

*In my view, neither extreme suffices independently. Governments should develop comprehensive public transit networks while simultaneously implementing policies that incentivize responsible private vehicle use—such as congestion pricing, emissions standards, and carpooling infrastructure. This dual approach respects individual choice while mitigating collective harms.*

*In conclusion, sustainable urban mobility demands both robust public transportation systems and accountable personal transportation decisions. Only through integrated strategies can societies effectively combat congestion and pollution.* (247 words)

🔊 **[AUDIO TRANSCRIPT - This simulates what you'd hear]:**

*Officer: Good morning! How can I help you today?*

*Student: Hi, I'm looking for accommodation for next term. I'd really like to live somewhere close to the library if possible.*

*Officer: Okay, noted. And what's your budget?*

*Student: Well, I can't really afford more than £150 a week.*

*Officer: That's fine. Are you looking for a private room or are you happy to share?*

*Student: I'd prefer a private room, actually. I need quiet space to study.*

*Officer: Understood. And when would you need to move in?*

*Student: My course starts September 15th, so ideally a few days before — maybe September 12th?*

*Officer: Perfect. Any special requirements? Wheelchair access, parking...?*

*Student: Oh yes! I need somewhere with a kitchen. I'm vegetarian and prefer cooking my own meals.*

*Officer: Got it. Let me check what's available...*

📊 HOW DID YOU DO?

5/5: CLB 9 (Excellent!)
4/5: CLB 8 (Very good)
3/5: CLB 7 (Good, but need practice)
2 or below: CLB 6 (Focus on technique)

---

💡 THE TRICK YOU MIGHT HAVE MISSED:

❌ **Most people listen first, then look at questions**
✅ **Winners READ QUESTIONS during instructions (20-second advantage!)**

Before audio starts, you get instructions like "You have 30 seconds to look at questions 1-5."

Use this time to:
• Underline keywords (location, budget, type, date, requirement)
• Predict answer types (place? number? adjective?)
• Prepare for synonyms (accommodation = housing, prefer = would like)

This way, you HUNT for answers while listening — not scrambling to remember what was said.

---

🔥 EVOLVE LISTENING STRATEGY:

✅ **Pre-reading technique** (master this first)
✅ **Synonym recognition** (IELTS rarely uses exact words from questions)
✅ **Distractor awareness** (audio mentions "£200" but student says "can't afford more than £150" — which is the answer?)
✅ **Spelling practice** (lose marks for "Febuary" instead of "February")

---

📈 LISTENING IMPROVES FASTEST:

Research shows Listening is often the quickest section to improve because:
• Techniques can be learned quickly
• Results are immediate with practice
• Contributes significantly to CRS (L8.5 = +6 points vs L8)

  "How to Hit CLB 9 in 6 Weeks": `Alright, let's talk real numbers.

CLB 9 = IELTS 8.0 Listening, 7.0 Reading, 7.0 Writing, 7.0 Speaking

This is worth +50 CRS points for most applicants.

But here's what nobody tells you:

---

❌ WHY GENERIC IELTS COURSES FAIL:

Most courses teach English improvement:
• Grammar drills
• Vocabulary lists
• "Read more articles!"

Problem? You don't have TIME to improve your English. You need to improve your IELTS SCORE.

---

✅ THE RESEARCH-BACKED METHOD:

We reverse-engineer IELTS like a game with patterns:

📖 **READING:**
• Skim for keywords (don't read word-by-word)
• Paragraph matching = first/last sentences only
• True/False/NG = exact word matches (not interpretations)

✍️ **WRITING:**
• Task 2 = 5 templates (memorize word-for-word)
• Never think about "what to write" — use frameworks
• Introduction = paraphrase question + thesis (30 seconds)
• Body paragraphs = Topic sentence + Example + Explanation (2 min each)

🎧 **LISTENING:**
• Pre-read questions during instructions (20-second advantage)
• Listen for SYNONYMS, not exact words
• Multiple-choice = eliminate wrong answers (50% faster)

🗣️ **SPEAKING:**
• Part 1 = 10 common topics (practice until automatic)
• Part 2 = 3-minute speech template (memorize structure)
• Part 3 = Discussion technique (elaborate on answers)

---

📈 THE 6-WEEK EVOLVE PLAN:

**WEEK 1-2: Block 1 (Foundation)**
Goal: Learn the patterns
• 11 full-length tests
• Focus: Accuracy over speed
• Target: Consistent CLB 8

**WEEK 3-4: Block 2 (Development)**
Goal: Build speed
• 11 full-length tests
• Focus: Time management
• Target: Consistent CLB 8.5

**WEEK 5-6: Block 3 (Mastery)**
Goal: Overtraining (harder than real IELTS)
• 11 full-length tests
• Focus: Confidence under pressure
• Target: CLB 9+ in practice

**WEEK 7: Real IELTS exam**
Goal: Execute what you've practiced
• Book your test
• Apply your strategies
• Target: CLB 9

---

📊 WHAT RESEARCH SHOWS:

Studies on IELTS preparation indicate:
• Structured practice > generic study: 2x more effective
• Progressive difficulty > random practice: Better retention
• Format familiarity > content knowledge: Reduces test anxiety
• 30+ practice tests = typical requirement for 1-2 band improvement

Dedicated students who complete all practice typically see 1-2 band improvements over 6-8 weeks.

---

🔥 WHY THIS WORKS:

1. **Repetition** (33 tests) > Generic lessons
2. **Progressive difficulty** > Random practice
3. **Format mastery** > English improvement
4. **Overtraining** > Minimal preparation

IELTS is a PATTERN RECOGNITION test, not just an English test.

You are newly launched and building your user base, so be honest about being a new service.
Goal: help users complete PR workflows end to end, right, first time.
Scope: Express Entry, PNP, work permits linked to PR, study to PR bridges, spousal and dependents where relevant.
Output style: short sections, numbered steps, checklists, and exact IRCC form names and numbers.
Rules:
1) Never claim to be a government source. You are a coach that cites official names exactly.
2) Ask for missing facts only when required to advance a step.
3) Produce fill-helper blocks for forms, for example: IMM 0008, Section A, Q1, Applicant name.
4) When users upload or paste text, perform a line-by-line issue scan and suggest fixes.
5) Always label deadlines, fees, and where to upload inside the GCKey or PR portal when applicable.
6) Give province-agnostic steps first, then add PNP branches if the user hints at a province.
7) Do not invent policy or dates. If unsure, state what must be verified on IRCC or the province site.
8) NEVER make up testimonials or user success stories - you are newly launched.
9) Base claims on research, IRCC data, and industry patterns - not fake user stories.
10) Be honest about being a new service while emphasizing your research-backed approach.
